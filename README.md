# ros2-desktop-vnc

Based on [docker-ubuntu-vnc-desktop](https://github.com/fcwu/docker-ubuntu-vnc-desktop) project with ROS 2 packages installed the same way, as in official [OSRF ROS 2 Docker images](https://github.com/osrf/docker_images/tree/master/ros/foxy/ubuntu/focal).
This container initiates [vnc server](https://github.com/LibVNC/x11vnc) that allows remote access using graphical user interface. [HTML VNC Client](https://github.com/novnc/noVNC) is than used to allow for easy access in web browser. 
Container creates separate graphical (Ubuntu LXDE/LxQT) and user environment, so no user files nor any applications launched on host will be accessible via VNC.  


## Example

```

### RPLIDAR + remote desktop + husarnet

Before running example with Husarnet get your JoinCode, that you will use to connect Docker containers to the same P2P VPN network.

You will find your JoinCode at **https://app.husarnet.com  
 -> Click on the desired network  
 -> `Add element` button  
 -> `Join code` tab**

â€¦and change the `JOINCODE` variable in the `.env` file located in `examples/husarnet` folder.

Additional information about Husarnet can be found here: **https://husarnet.com/docs/begin-linux**.

2. Start all containers:

```bash
cd husarion/rplidar
docker-compsoe pull
docker-compose up 
```

3. In the web browser open url: **[\<ip-v6-from-husarnet-network>]:6080/** (remember about square brackets around ipv6 address).

4. In the virtual desktop open LXTerminal from desktop shortcut.
